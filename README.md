# Guess - A - Nuber
This is a simle console game "Guess A  Number"


"Guess the Number" is a 10-level game where your opponent "the computer" chooses a random number between "1 and (depending on the level) a number" and your task is to guess that number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint as to whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number. In each level on the last try you get a hint option for the correct number. In each next level you try to guess decreases and range of guess corect number are upping.
